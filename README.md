"# Digit_Classification" 
In this project ,I took handwritten images of the number 0-9 from the MNIST dataset , built a CNN model , and trained it to predict the correct label for the digit in
the image. The MNIST dataset is a dataset of 28Ã—28 grayscale images of handwritten digits between 0 and 9. There are 60,000 examples in the training dataset and 10,000 examples in the test dataset.
